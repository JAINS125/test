Your task is to generate a summary in the variable ‘output’ in the form of a brief initial sentence and about 5-6 bullet points. You can use more bullet points if it is required. The initial sentence should state that an overview of all-causality and treatment-related adverse events by treatment group are provided in tables, which should be identified by specific number, respectively. The table number should be in the form of Table X, where X is an counting number, such as 30, or in the form of a table with multiple hierarchic levels, such as 14.3.1.2. Each bullet point should cover a different aspect of the adverse events. The important points to cover include the total number and associated percentage of participants who experienced all-causality treatment-emergent adverse events and also the number and percentage of participants who experienced treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events. Any time a number and percentage are presented, the associated table that contains those data must be cited in parentheses and if possible hyperlinked. Another bullet should summarize the difference in all-causality treatment-emergent adverse events by treatment group, arm, cohort, or other noted division of participants in the trial. Another bullet should report if any deaths occurred during the study and again refer to the appropriate table that reports information about deaths on trial. In the same bullet, the number of serious adverse events should be reported by treatment group, arm, or cohort, including the name of the group. For example, a group might be called “acetaminophen 3000mg” and another group might be called “placebo.” The summary regarding serious adverse events should include how many of these events were considered treatment-related by the principal investigator, and also by the sponsor. The tables with these data should also be cited. Another bullet should discuss the number and percentage of participants who discontinued the study due to treatment-emergent adverse events, for each group, respectively, along with the citation of the table that has these data. For all of these cases, the number of participants should be followed by the percentage in parentheses, such as “4 (6.0%)” and the percentage should be given to one decimal place of accuracy. The summary should also include the data relative to those participants who discontinued temporarily but then returned to the study. If the majority of adverse events were mild or moderate then state “The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate.” If, however, there were many adverse events that were graded as severe, then summarize the number and percentage of severe adverse events by group, along with the reference to the specifical table or tables that hold these data. Finally, the bullet point list should also include the median duration of treatment for each group by name, respectively. Please use the abbreviations of AE for adverse event, TEAE for treatment-related adverse event, and SAE for serious adverse event.”

If there were SAEs during the trial, they should be summarized for each group, arm, cohort, or other categorization in terms of the system order class (SOC) and preferred term. Mention that SAE narratives, if there are any SAEs during the trial, are found in Section 14.3.3. In general, all SAEs should be accounted for in this summary. In contrast, when reporting on TEAEs, the data should be summarized for each group, arm, cohort, or other categorization in terms of SOC and preferred term, with the top 4 to 5 SOCs and preferred terms identified. Based on the provided input, report the threshold incidence that is used. For example, “The highest number of participants reporting TEAEs by SOC (Table 14.3.1.2.3) were: Infections and infestations followed by vascular disorders and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.” When reporting on TEAEs by preferred term an example would be “The most frequently reported AEs were pyrexia, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia (Table 24, Table 14.3.1.2.2).” Summarize the incidence between the groups, arms, cohorts, or other categories of participant. If the incidence is similar, within 5% of each other, then report “The incidence of these AEs was mostly comparable between groups” otherwise identify the group or groups that had higher incidence and report “A higher incidence of AEs was noted in the following group(s)” followed by the list of groups and the incidence in parentheses.

Using bullet points, highlight the most frequent AE (or if the incidence is similar, the top AEs) for the top-reported SOCs.

DF- please keep in mind that a table with a number like 28 is almost assuredly made from other tables such as 14.3.x.x.... and is a summary that is based on a threshold for inclusion.      ALSO, In the example, the text describes an incidence of AEs that is >= 5% in Table 18. I don't see Table 18 here but this is the kind of table that I would have made as a medical writer from Table 14.3.1.2.3 to simplify things for the reader. The 5% cut-off would have been provided for me as a choice. The summary is for Table 18 (not shown), and notes the highest number of participants reporting AEs by SOC. Here, they do it just for one SOC (Infections and infestations). Oftentimes, the top 3 or perhaps up to 5 may be used depending on the data. For example, if one SOC is at 35% and the others are at 5%, then it would make sense to just report the one at 35%. But if it were the case that SOCs were at 25%, 20%, 19%, and then the rest at 2%, then reporting the top 3 would be more reasonable. After reporting the SOCs, then they report the more common AEs by preferred term (nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and rhinitis). Again, the decision as to how many to include depends on the data %s. Note that they do not provide the actual numbers and %s here and I find this to be mistake on their part. If you can say ""The incidence of these AEs was mostly comparable between groups"" then you can give the reader the data so that the reader assess if he/she believes you when you offer a judgment of ""mostly comparable."" After that is a remark on severity of AEs (mostly mild or moderate, with the supporting data). They noted 1 participant with a severe AE and noted what that AE was.  Next they provide a summary of AEs by SOC following Infections and infestations. This is not a preferred format in my opinion because there are bullets on the SOCs that follow but not on the case of Infections and infestations.

DF- Similar to AESI -- it depends on the drug/setting. If no data here then just say ""Not applicable."" -- OK, the sample summary has a heading of ""Other Serious Adverse Events"" which is not the same thing as ""Other Significant AEs"" -- AEs can be ""signficiant"" and not be SAEs. So I do not find that to be an appropriate header if the summary is supposed to be for ""Other significant AEs"" -- Note that every SAE has a written narrative in the CSR. A narrative is a (multi) paragraph description of the event and the resolution. Something like ""Subject 001, a white male, 59 years old, with prior history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, presented to the emergency room on September 6, 2023 (Study Day 46) at 2:30pm with a fever (103.5F) and dyspnea (moderate).

Of note in this section, if the SAEs were unrelated to treatment that should be stated (and it is). If the patients all recovered that should be stated (and it is). Patients can recover, recover with sequelae (meaning they have ongoing issues), or not recover. I am assuming there are treatment groups with 50, 30, and 10 mg (but this is not really clear here). In the text there is a statement ""Neither event was severe, and both participants recovered."" I do not understand this statement. All (every one) of the called out SAEs in this list the migraine, esophageal spasm, migraine (2nd), neurogenic bladder, are each described as severe, and we wouldn't say ""neither"" for a list of 4 things. Note that there is a description of a participant getting a moderate herpes infection that is stated as *related* and led to discontinuation. Yet at the top, it says ""all events were assessed as unrelated""  so this appears problematic.  There is a section on hearing (this must be of speical interest).

The summary describes a period of time for which the treatment group has higher proportion of subjets with high liver parameters (AST, ALT, total bilirubin) than the placebo group. I am noting that the summary does not tell me exactly what the proportions are (it should). The time frame of 6 months follows from the table header (and presumably the duration of the trial) but the choice in the summary of up to Month 3 is not obvious to me; perhaps this was the end of a run-in period or perhaps there is another significant reason to choose Month 3. I have to admit it is not entirely easy for me to check these data as the data are change from baseline and so I see a median (range) on say alanine aminotransferase of 1.00 (-61.0, 33.0) and I'm thinking someone dropped 61 points and the typical normal range is 30-50 IU/I.

Those limits are <50  diastolic (stting), <90 systolic (stting), and a pulse of > 120 bpm. Generally ""normal"" blood pressue is 120/80 (""or less"") but low pressure (hypotension) is generally at 90/60 or less. Here they went with less than 90/50. Normal pulse rate at rest is 60-99 bpm. Above that is tachycardia, but they went with > 120 rather than >=100. The language they use is not entirely intuitive here: ""subjects met the categorical summarization criteria"" -- well, meeting the criteria here is not good.  They also have limits on the increase in blood pressure from baseline of 20 for diastolic and 30 for systolic. If the investigator finds that these results are not clinically significant then this should be stated, and it is ""None of these findings were considered clinically significant by the investigator."" Clinical significant is generally defined as something that has a tangible effect on daily life. It's a curious finding to say that someone having a resting heart rate of more than 120, or BP below 90/50 would not be a significant finding -- but if that is what the investigator reports then that is what must be written of course. (One thing I would do as a medical writer in this case is go to the listings and see that the participants involved were noted with AEs of hypotension, tachycardia, or something else related to increased blood pressure.) From the data that are provided in Table 14.3.5.1.1, I don't believe I could validate the claims for the number of participants who met the criteria. Look at the table, for example, I see in Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure in a minimum of 83 in Week 4 at 30 min. So that tells us that at least one person got a SBP of < 90. We don't know if more than 1 person was less than 90. The same goes for the other claims because are giving the ranges. So again as medical writer I would have to go to the listings for each participant and verify that the claims are correct.  ---   In contrast for the ECG section, the investigator found that some results were clinically significant (but not considered related to treatment) and these are noted in the bullet point summary. The thing here is that the summary is based on Table 36 (which I am not seeing). From the Tables such as 14.3.6.1.2, someone (or an AI) would need to ""understand"" what is a meaningful result (like, how long can a QT interval be before it needs to be noted)  and these criteria do not appear in the Table 14.2.6.1.x examples. I am presuming that Table 36 provides the summary based on the knowledge of what is a ""finding"" -- would be good to check if possible -- but I really don't see a LLM making a summary like what we see here without having access to Table 36. I mean, that would be pretty cool if it could do that with 95+% accuracy without Table 36.  -- There are no findings for the physical exam but there were some severe AEs pertaining to skin tolerability which led to discontinuation. In a way, similar to the case above, when I look through Tables 14.3.8.1 I am seeing the count of skin-related AEs but I have not seeing severity mentioned here. The summary text speaks to severity, so that must be in Table 30, which I am not seeing. There is also a reference to 14.3.7.3 which I am not seeing. Perhaps I am missing something to find these tables (clearly, I'm new to databricks!) but without those tables I don't really see how the summary could be written as it is.  As far as the other sections, I was a little surprised to see a suicide/self-harm assessment -- I don't know if that was associated in prior research with the study drug. Table 14.3.7.6 shows ""not created"" so I don't know what to make of that section. The other items appear to be adjudicated by separate panels and were not determined to be events of interest (EOI <- I presume this is what is meant).",Yes,"Eshanika, Shreyans - Could you please check where is table 30"
